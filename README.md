# house-price-prediction
Data science project applying linear regression to predict real estate prices. Demonstrates EDA, model training, and performance evaluation using Scikit-learn.

### Dataset Overview
This project uses a dataset containing details of residential properties such as:

- Area (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Furnishing Status
- Price (target variable)

The dataset is used to train a regression model that predicts house prices based on these features.

### Tools and Technologies
- Python – Main programming language
- Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization and plotting
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning (Linear Regression, train-test split, model evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for analysis and experimentation

### ✅ What Was Achieved
- Conducted data exploration and cleaning to prepare the dataset
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices
- Evaluated the model using R² score and RMSE
- Visualized feature relationships and prediction performance
- Established a solid foundation for future improvements and deployment (e.g., with Streamlit)
